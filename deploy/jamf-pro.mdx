description: 'This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use Jamf Pro to configure and deploy Zappl in your environment.'
---

>For a successful Zappl deployment with Jamf Pro, please follow the steps in the order outlined below. It is important that all configuration profiles are installed prior to the Zappl installer being deployed.

## <Icon icon="layer-group" size={32}/> Categories 
<Info>The Categories aren’t essential to deployment, but they can help keep your Jamf Pro environment neat and organised.</Info>

We’d recommend two Categories for Zappl deployment;

`Zappl`
> For housing the necessary Configuration Profiles, Policies, Scripts etc.

`Application Updates`
> A useful Category to be used with the Self Service updates.

#### Adding Categories
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to _Jamf Pro > Settings > Categories_ and click **New**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Type in the Category name, and optionally alter it’s priority in Self Service.
    ![Jamf Pro Category](/images/new_category.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Save** the Category, and follow this process for any other relevant Categories you want to add (**`Application Updates`**).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>These Categories are now ready to use throughout the Zappl deployment in Jamf Pro.</Check>

<br /><br />

## <Icon icon="sliders" size={32}/> Configuration Profiles

#### Adding the JSON Schema
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open/download our [JSON file](https://github.com/dare-tech/zappl/blob/main/Config%20Profiles/JSON%20Schema/Zappl%20Preferences.json).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In Jamf Pro, navigate to _Computers > Configuration Profiles_ and click **New**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the general payload, give the new profile a name, assign it to a category, set the level as **Computer Level** and the distribution method as **Install Automatically**.
    ![JSON Profile](/images/json_profile.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Under the payload options, locate the **Application & Custom Settings** payload, select **External Applications** and select **Add**.
    ![JSON Profile](/images/json_add.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Under the Source dropdown, select **Custom Schema**.
    ![JSON Schema](/images/json_schema.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Set the preference domain as `com.dare.zappl.preferences` and click **Add Schema**.
    ![JSON Schema](/images/json_add_schema.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Copy the entire JSON Schema that we opened in an earlier step, Paste it into the text area and click **Save**.
    ![JSON Schema](/images/json_add_custom.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Customise Preferences
    Configure your desired Zappl behaviour and user experience using the keys outlined in [our Preferences page](/customise/preferences).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Scope the profile to all computers where you plan to deploy Zappl (e.g. _All Managed Clients_), then click **Save**.
    ![JSON Schema](/images/json_scope.webp)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<br />
#### Managed Login Items
<Note>As of macOS 13 (Ventura), users can disable launch daemons through the Login Items option in System Settings. Zappl uses launch daemons to run automatically in the background, and these daemons must always be enabled for Zappl to function.</Note>

>The following profile ensures Zappl can run in the background by preventing users from disabling Zappl's launch daemons. This is achieved by whitelisting Zappl's Team ID (`JTYACQP7Y5`).

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Download our [.mobileconfig file](https://github.com/dare-tech/zappl/blob/main/Config%20Profiles/Zappl%20-%20Pre-Approve%20Login%20Items.mobileconfig).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In Jamf Pro, navigate to _Computers > Configuration Profiles_ and click **Upload**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Choose File**, then locate the `.mobileconfig` file you downloaded in the first step and click **Upload**.
    ![Login Items](/images/loginitems_upload.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Scope**, add your desired scope target for the profile and click **Save**.
    ![Login Items](/images/loginitems_scope.webp)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<br />
#### Full Disk Access
<Note>As of macOS 13 (Ventura), full disk access is required in order to update or remove macOS apps. The Zappl agent is responsible for performing all app updates, therefore full disk access (`SystemPolicyAllFiles`) needs to be granted to the agent via a configuration profile.</Note>

>To ensure Zappl is allowed to perform updates, simply add the below configuration profile to your MDM and scope it out to devices which Zappl will be deployed to.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Download our [.mobileconfig file](https://github.com/dare-tech/zappl/blob/main/Config%20Profiles/Zappl%20-%20PPPC.mobileconfig).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In Jamf Pro, navigate to _Computers > Configuration Profiles_ and click **Upload**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Choose File**, then locate the `.mobileconfig` file you downloaded in the first step and click **Upload**.
    ![Login Items](/images/pppc_upload.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Scope**, add your desired scope target for the profile and click **Save**.

## <Icon icon="store" size={32}/> Self Service Updates
<Tip>We recommend setting up a policy in your Jamf Pro environment which allows users to install updates on-demand at a time of their convenience to supplement the automatic recurring update prompts.</Tip>

#### Creating the Self Service Policy
<Info>Before creating this policy, ensure you have added the Deploy Software Script to your Jamf Pro server.</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In Jamf Pro, navigate to _Computers > Policies_ and click **New**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the **General** payload, set a display name and category. Then, set the execution frequency to **Ongoing**.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-policy.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the **Scripts** payload, then locate the `Zappl - Deploy Software` script and click **Add**.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-script.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Under the parameter values, set the Action parameter as `selfService`. Leave all other parameters blank.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-parameters.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the **Scope** tab, set your desired scoping target. It is good practice to set the scope for this policy as a Smart Computer Group which uses the Zappl Installation Status Extension Attributes to target computers that have Zappl installed.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-scope.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the **Self Service** tab and check `Make the policy available in Self Service`.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-tab.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Set the display name and button labels for the policy.<br />Optionally, set a description to be displayed to users in Self Service.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-buttons.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Upload an icon to be displayed in the Self Service item.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-icon.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the Self Service item to a relevant category. Optionally, you can include the item in the featured category to make it easier for users to access.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-categories.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Finally, **Save** the policy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### User Experience

<Steps>
  <Step>
    After locating the Application Updates item in Self Service, the user can click **Install** to initialise the update check.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-ux1.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The below prompt is briefly displayed whilst Zappl initialises and checks for updates.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-ux2.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    If Zappl finds updates, the user is informed via an update prompt which outlines the required updates and offers options to either install or skip. If the user skips the updates, any remaining deferrals the user currently has from the automatic Scheduled Update Prompts remain unaffected.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-ux3.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    If Zappl finds no pending updates, the user is informed via the below prompt.
    ![Self Service](/images/self-service-ux4.webp)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<br /><br />

## <Icon icon="puzzle-piece" size={32}/> Extension Attributes
<Info>**Jamf Pro offers extension attributes which provide better visibility into Zappl's status across your estate.** While the Zappl portal displays all necessary information for admins, adding Jamf Pro extension attributes can be beneficial for administrators who primarily use Jamf Pro and may not have access to your Zappl portal.</Info>
