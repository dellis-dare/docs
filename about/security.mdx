**Zappl was developed with security at the forefront of our focus every step of the way. At DARE we are Cyber Essentials certified and maintain strict internal security protocols to ensure the security of our clients and their information.**
  
We constantly monitor our systems using trusted security solutions so that we can identify and address any security concerns that may come to our attention in a timely manner.

### Your Data

<Info>**We store all customer information securely in fully certified EU data centres which comply by data protection laws and implement strong security measures.**</Info>
When your data is being sent from client devices to the Zappl reporting portal, it is fully encrypted using complex RSA and AES encryption algorithms. This ensures your data is never exposed to any potential attackers. Two-factor authentication is mandatory and enforced for all accounts accessing the [Online Portal](/portal/accounts).

### App Verification

<Info>**We take a comprehensive approach to verifying that apps are legitimate before allowing installs, and we immediately cancel the installation of any software deemed unsafe.**</Info>

When our Zappl server identifies new updates for apps within our catalog, the software is downloaded on the server and checked for any Malware. If the software fails this check, the new version is **not added** to our database and will **not be downloaded** by the Zappl agent on any client computers.

If the software passes the above check, we proceed to add the new version to our app database. The Zappl agent (installed on client machines) will then attempt to download the software directly from the vendor. Prior to running the installation, we verify the developer signing information using either the signature on the .pkg file, or the signature of the .app file within a .dmg or .zip installer. If the signature **does not meet** the verified signature of the software vendor, the download is **immediately deleted** and the software is **not installed**.

As an additional security measure, we add an expected `sha256 hash` of each installer file to our app database. If a downloaded installer file **does not match** this expected file hash, the download is **immediately deleted** and the software is **not installed**.
