<Update label="v1.2.1" description="2025-03-27">
	Added option to skip automatic permissions setting to allow it to be done with a delay through the post-install script. This is for apps where gatekeeper takes a while to finish verification. Also added logic to allow app installs to make up to 10 API calls daily if the specified app was not found in the offline app catalog.
</Update>
