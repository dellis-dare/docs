The first admin account in your online Zappl portal is created during the initial sign-up process.

<Warning>This account becomes the super admin and cannot be deleted, so it's best to use a dedicated mailbox for this purpose — for example, zappl@acme.corp — rather than an individual's email address.</Warning>

When you sign up, an email invitation is sent to the provided address. After accepting this invite, you'll be prompted to create a password and set up two-factor authentication. Once logged in, you can create additional admin and standard accounts using the steps outlined below.

#### Creating User Accounts

<Steps>
    <Step>
        On the navigation bar to the left, under **Management**, select **Accounts**, then select **Create New Account**.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the `Create Account` dialog, enter the email address, name, and select an account role from the dropdown. Once done, click **Create**.
        <Info>The **Admin** role provides full access to manage user accounts and reports.<br />The **Standard** role is read-only, allowing users to log in and view dashboards, but not manage users or reports.</Info>

    </Step>
    <Step>
        The new account will now be listed under the main accounts section and will have a `Pending` status until the user accepts the email invitation and successfully sets up their password and two-factor authentication.
        <Info>To modify the email address for the user after creation, click the pencil icon, change the email address and click save. A new invite will be sent to the new email address.<br />If the invite expires, simply click the bin icon on the user item to remove the user, and repeat the above account creation steps to send a new invite.</Info>
