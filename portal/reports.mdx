Reports are particularly useful for keeping other stakeholders, such as security personnel, up to date on compliance without requiring them to log into the portal manually.

There are two report types â€” **Compliance** and **Application**.

## Compliance Report

The compliance report provides a summary of all key information highlighted by the Zappl portal in PDF format. 

The report consists of the following sections:

  <Accordion title="Application Summary" icon="list">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Most Used Application Compliance" icon="layer-group">
    Lists the 25 most-used apps in your estate, showing their eligible and total app compliance. The list is sorted from most to least installations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Least Compliant Applications" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Lists the 10 least compliant apps in your estate, with the least compliant app appearing at the top of the list.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Device Summary" icon="laptop">
    Displays eligible and total device compliance in your estate as shown on the [Dashboard](/portal/dashboard). 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Devices with Highest App Count" icon="arrow-up-wide-short">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Least Compliant Devices" icon="triangle-exclamation">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Alert Summary" icon="bell">
    Displays the same alert summary found on the [Dashboard](/portal/dashboard), plus information on devices with updates disabled, devices with zero remaining deferrals, and devices with Zappl self-updates disabled.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
