Unlike traditional patch management tracking methods, Zappl considers both device and app eligibility. This makes it simple to toggle between total compliance and eligible complianceâ€”the latter filtering out update deferrals, offline devices, and other exceptions.

Leverage the built-in compliance and application reports by scheduling recurring email updates to your security team members. This feature allows them to stay informed about compliance levels without needing to log in to the portal.
