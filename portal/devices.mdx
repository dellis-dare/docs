The Zappl portal provides an overview of each device's compliance levels and essential information, including device name, associated user, macOS version, app count, and last check-in date. Clicking on a device takes you to the individual [Device Records](/portal/device-records).

## Device List

You can use the search field at the top of the page to quickly locate a specific device within your estate.

The following device attributes are all searchable in this field:

- **Device Name**
- **Last User** (This is the local username)
- **User Full Name**
- **Serial Number**

Each column in the device list allows sorting of devices either alphanumerically or by compliance levels. An arrow indicates the currently sorted column, pointing up or down to show the sort direction.

In the compliance column, beneath the blue compliance bar, you'll find two figures. The left figure represents the number of compliant apps, while the right figure shows the number of non-compliant apps. Clicking either figure filters the app list for that device. For example, clicking the **compliant apps** figure displays all compliant apps for that specific device.

Clicking either the device name or the **View** button takes you to individual [Device Records](portal/device-records).
