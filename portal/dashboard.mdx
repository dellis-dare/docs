## Devices

The device widget on the dashboard displays an average compliance level for all devices in your estate. Zappl calculates app compliance for each device, sums the percentages, and divides by the total number of devices to obtain the average figures.

There are two compliance figures that can be viewed using the tab — **Eligible Compliance** and **All Compliance**.

#### Eligible Compliance

Eligible Compliance is designed to calculate compliance **only for devices that meet specific eligibility criteria**. For a device to be considered eligible, it must meet the following requirements:

<Check>The device has checked in within the last 14 days.</Check>
<Check>The user hasn't deferred any pending updates on the device.</Check>
<Check>Updates are enabled on the device (including silent updates, update prompts, and per-app updates).</Check>

This feature allows you to easily exclude irrelevant devices from your statistics, providing more accurate figures at the click of a button.

#### All Compliance

All Compliance represents the total device compliance, considering every device in your estate without excluding any from the calculations.

## Applications

The Applications widget displays average compliance on an application basis for all apps installed across your estate. Similar to device compliance, Zappl calculates this by determining compliance levels for each app found across your estate, summing them, and dividing by the total number of apps.

Application compliancy follows the same theme as the device based compliancy — **Eligible Compliance** and **All Compliance**.
