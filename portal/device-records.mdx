## Device Information

The top half of each device record displays information about the device on the left hand column, and information relating to Zappl on the right hand column.

#### Information Breakdown

<Warning>From the above table, **macOS Version**, **FileVault**, **SIP**, **Gatekeeper**, and **Disk Space** are not controlled by Zappl. We display this data for informational purposes only. Use your MDM to enforce things like macOS Updates, FileVault etc.</Warning>

#### Example

In the _ACME_ Zappl environment, we've determined from the dashboard view that while eligible device compliance is **100%**, total device compliance is only **88%**.

A closer look at the devices list reveals this is due to `Sophia's MacBook` having a remarkably low compliance score of just **7%**. 

Upon examining the device record, we see that this device hasn't affected the eligible compliance because it's considered _non-eligible_ due to the user deferring pending updates when prompted.

<Note>`Prompts Allowed` or `Background Updates` showing as disabled, or the `Last Check-in` timestamp being older than 14 days ago would also cause the device to become non-eligible.<br />For additional app-based context related to the example scenario above, please refer to the **Applications** section below.</Note>

## Applications

Below the device information header, you'll find a tab that lets you switch between the device-specific Applications and Logs views. The Applications view is selected by default.

The Applications view displays a list of all apps installed on the device, offering context about their status and reasons for non-compliance.

To inspect a specific app, use the **Search Applications** field to filter the list.

You can also sort by the `Name`, `Latest Version`, `Date Released` and `Compliance` columns. 

In the following example, we examine the scenario above more closely to understand why `Sophia's MacBook` has such low compliance. The image reveals that Sophia has 15 apps installed, with only VLC player running the latest available version — making it the sole compliant application.

For a more detailed inspection of each app, click the **Details** button in the corresponding row. Clicking this button reveals additional details, such as the app's macOS requirements, whether updates have been permitted for the app, and whether an update is cached locally because the app is currently in use.

The image below shows that the Firefox update is cached locally because the user is currently running the application. As a result, it couldn't be updated silently and required a user prompt, which Sophia then deferred.

<Note>If **Updates Allowed** is set to false for a given application, it renders that app ineligible for both device-based and app-based compliance calculations. To enable updates for the app, see Allowed Installs and Excluded Installs.</Note>

## Logs

The Logs view displays error or warning messages generated by the Zappl agent within the last 30 days. This feature is invaluable for troubleshooting app update or install issues, as it provides quick access to relevant errors and warnings without the need to sift through the full Zappl logs.
![Portal Log View](/images/portal-log-view.webp)

By default, all errors and warnings are displayed together. To view only errors or only warnings, simply click the **Errors** or **Warnings** filter buttons.
![Portal Log Filters](/images/portal-log-filters.webp)

You can utilise the **Search Logs** field to quickly filter out logs using key words.
![Portal Log Search](/images/portal-log-search.webp)

<Warning>All logs are purged from the portal after 30 days. To view older logs, refer to [Logs and Errors](/other/logs-errors).</Warning>
