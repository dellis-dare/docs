>**In addition to patching apps, Zappl can install applications. This feature is one of the Command Line Options available with the Zappl agent, making it easy to integrate into Jamf Pro policies using the Deploy Software Script.**



Traditionally, to deploy applications via Jamf Pro, administrators have to manually package the app installer and deploy it through a Jamf Pro policy. This approach quickly leads to outdated installers, requiring frequent updates to maintain compliance.

By replacing existing app deployment policies in Jamf Pro with Zappl policies, this issue is resolved. Zappl ensures the installation of the latest version of the app, eliminating the need for manual updates.


#### Creating an App Install Policy
<Steps>
    <Step>
        In Jamf Pro, navigate to _Computers > Policies_ and click **New**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the **General** payload, configure a suitable **Display Name**, **Category**, **Trigger** and **Execution Frequency**.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        Locate the **Zappl - Deploy Software** script and click **Add**.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        Enter the **Unique Identifier** as the **Application Identifier** parameter value (The unique identifier can be found in the [App Catalog](zappl.co/app-catalog)), then enter `install` as the **Action** parameter value for a silent install, or `install-showProgress` as the **Action** parameter value for an install with an installation progress prompt (useful for Jamf Self Service installs).
