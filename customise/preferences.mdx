        #### Preference Structure
        The JSON schema profile is comprised of three main preference dictionaries; the **General Options**, the **Scheduled Update Options** and the **Forced Update Options**.
        <img width="300" noZoom src="/images/json-structure.webp"/>
        
        The scheduled and forced update options have identical preference keys that serve the same purpose for the scheduled and forced update mechanisms respectively, although the forced update options require fewer preferences.
        
        This is partly because deferrals and grace periods for forced updates are configured on a per-app basis when you mark apps for forced updates, and partly because there is slightly less functionality required in the forced update feature.

                By default, Zappl attempts to install updates silently for Apps that are not in use once every hour. To disable these background update attempts, uncheck this option (**not recommended**).
                
                If you wish to disable all updates, this is the first of two settings that need to be unchecked, the second being the [Allow Recurring Update Prompts](/customise/preferences#allow-recurring-update-prompts) option.

                By default, Zappl prompts users to quit Apps that need to update on a regular recurring interval which can be configured in the Scheduled Update Options.
                
                If you wish to disable the _recurring scheduled update prompts_ and only attempt to install updates silently when Apps are not in use, uncheck this option and check the [Allow Hourly Attempt Updates](/customise/preferences#allow-hourly-attempt-updates) option only.
                
                If you wish to disable _all updates_, this is the second of two settings that need to be unchecked along with the [Allow Hourly Attempt Updates](/customise/preferences#allow-hourly-attempt-updates) option.

                If you wish to disable this and either stay on a specific Zappl version, or push out updates for Zappl manually, **uncheck** this option.

                Although the scheduled cached update check is run on a frequent basis every day, the preferences in the Run Frequency Options dictionary ensure that users are only prompted to install updates on a specified frequency, e.g. once every week.
                
                First, use the **Run Frequency Option** dropdown to define a method of frequently prompting users to update.
                ![Run Frequency Option](/images/prefs-run-frequency.webp)
                
                [`Specify Patch Frequency`](/customise/preferences#specify-patch-frequency-preferences)
                Select this option if you prefer not to tie the updates to a specified weekday and instead run updates on a recurring frequency, _e.g. once every day, once every week etc_.
                <br />[`Specify Recurring Patch Day`](/customise/preferences#specific-patch-day-preferences)
                Select this option if you want to specify a day of each week to prompt users if they have pending updates, _e.g. every Tuesday_.
                
                When you select one of these two options, preferences that relate to each option automatically populate.

                `Frequency to Prompt Users`
                <br />Use this dropdown to select how often you want to prompt users to update.

                `Frequency Elapsed Behaviour`
                <br />This dropdown determines how Zappl should behave if the user defers the update. Selecting the `Single Prompt Mode` option will ensure that if the user defers the update, they will not get prompted to update again until the configured frequency has elapsed again, e.g. one week later.
                Alternatively, select `Recurring Prompt Mode` if you prefer to prompt the user on a recurring basis after deferring until the update is installed.
