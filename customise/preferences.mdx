        #### Preference Structure
        The JSON schema profile is comprised of three main preference dictionaries; the **General Options**, the **Scheduled Update Options** and the **Forced Update Options**.
        ![App Install](/images/json-structure.webp)
        
        The scheduled and forced update options have identical preference keys that serve the same purpose for the scheduled and forced update mechanisms respectively, although the forced update options require fewer preferences.
        
        This is partly because deferrals and grace periods for forced updates are configured on a per-app basis when youÂ mark apps for forced updates, and partly because there is slightly less functionality required in the forced update feature.
