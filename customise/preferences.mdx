        #### Preference Structure
        The JSON schema profile is comprised of three main preference dictionaries; the **General Options**, the **Scheduled Update Options** and the **Forced Update Options**.
        <img width="300" noZoom src="/images/json-structure.webp"/>
        
        The scheduled and forced update options have identical preference keys that serve the same purpose for the scheduled and forced update mechanisms respectively, although the forced update options require fewer preferences.
        
        This is partly because deferrals and grace periods for forced updates are configured on a per-app basis when you mark apps for forced updates, and partly because there is slightly less functionality required in the forced update feature.

                Although the scheduled cached update check is run on a frequent basis every day, the preferences in the Run Frequency Options dictionary ensure that users are only prompted to install updates on a specified frequency, e.g. once every week.
                
                First, use the **Run Frequency Option** dropdown to define a method of frequently prompting users to update.
                ![Run Frequency Option](/images/prefs-run-frequency.webp)
                
                [`Specify Patch Frequency`](/customise/preferences#specify-patch-frequency-preferences)

                <br />[`Specify Recurring Patch Day`](/customise/preferences#specific-patch-day-preferences)
                Select this option if you want to specify a day of each week to prompt users if they have pending updates, _e.g. every Tuesday_.

                #### `Frequency Elapsed Behaviour`
                This dropdown determines how Zappl should behave if the user defers the update. Selecting the `Single Prompt Mode` option will ensure that if the user defers the update, they will not get prompted to update again until the configured frequency has elapsed again, e.g. one week later.
                Alternatively, select `Recurring Prompt Mode` if you prefer to prompt the user on a recurring basis after deferring until the update is installed.

                Selecting this option ensures that if a computer is offline on the defined weekly patch day, the user can be prompted to update at the next available opportunity as opposed to waiting until the next patch day. Leave this **unchecked** if you prefer to ensure that prompts are only ever displayed on the configured patch day.

                This dropdown helps you determine how frequently users are prompted to update on the configured patch day when they defer an update.<br />Selecting the `Single Prompt Mode` option ensures that when a user defers the update, they won't get prompted to update until the following week on the configured patch day.<br />If you prefer to prompt the user to update on a recurring basis on the configured patch day, select the `Recurring Prompt Mode` option.

                #### `Specify Deferral Limit`
                Configuring a deferral limit for updates ensures that users cannot defer the update indefinitely. The deferral limit you configure here is how many times the user will be allowed to defer the update before being forced to install the update. Use the **Deferral Limit** field to specify your desired deferral limit.
                ![Specify Deferral Limit](/images/prefs-specify-deferral-limit.webp)
                
                #### `Disable Deferral Limit`
                Selecting this option will allow users to defer the update indefinitely. We recommend only using this option if you plan to create a workflow which utilises forcing the update on demand.

                #### `Disable Deferrals`
                Selecting this option will mean that users will not be given any opportunity to defer and will instead be given a [Grace Period](/customise/preferences#grace-period) to save any work before the updates are automatically installed.

                This is the amount of time in **minutes** a user is given to save work before updates install automatically when deferrals are either not available or not configured.<br />By default this value is `15` minutes, therefore you only need to configure this preference if you wish to decrease or increase the default grace period.

                You can use the Run Limitation Options dictionary to apply exclusions to the frequency options you previously configured for **Scheduled Updates**. The same options are also available in the **Forced Updates** dictionary to allow you to limit when Zappl is permitted to prompt users to update any Apps that have been marked for forced updates.<br />A checkbox is available and by default ticked for each day of the week. If there is a particular day of the week you want to ensure update prompts are never displayed to the user, simply **uncheck** the box next to the day. This is useful when using the [Specify Patch Frequency](/customise/preferences#specific-patch-frequency-preferences) option, or when specifying a patch day with the [Missed Update Prompts](/customise/preferences#specific-patch-day-preferences) option checked.
                ![Run Limitation Options](/images/prefs-run-limits-checkbox.webp)
                
                <Note>If you have specified a weekly patch day, and that patch day is then _unchecked_ in the run limitation options, the run limitation for that day will be ignored and the user will still be prompted to update on the configured patch day.</Note>
                
                Each day also offers the option to define an allowed update time window. Selecting an allowed time window means that whenever Zappl runs outside of that window, update prompts will be skipped and Zappl will exit with no further action.<br />By default, the start time is `12.00am` and the end time is `11.59pm`, but you can easily change this on a per-day basis by modifying the values in the fields.
                ![Run Limitation - Allowed Update Times](/images/prefs-run-limits-allowed-time.webp)
                
                If you want to define an exclusion time window, e.g. do not prompt between `2pm` and `4pm` but allow prompts for the rest of the day, simply reverse the timestamps as shown below.

                The prompt shown when deferrals are not available or not configured (Available in the **Scheduled** and **Forced Updates** dictionaries).
                
                #### `Custom Self Service Prompt Size`
                The prompt shown when a user initiated the [Self Service Updates](/deploy/jamf-pro#self-service-updates) policy (Available in the **Scheduled Update** options dictionary).
                
                The default size of the update prompts is set to provide enough space for the default text. If you change the text, the prompt size might become too small or too large. If it's too large, you'll see a lot of white space. If it's too small, you'll need to scroll to read all the text.<br />To remediate this, use the custom prompt size preferences listed above to adjust the size of various prompts displayed to users.
                
                <Note>When using `Vertical List` as the app list option, Zappl automatically adds on the required prompt height to your custom prompt height to allow enough space for the App list to be shown beneath the prompt message. When configuring your custom prompt size, first switch the [App List Type](/customise/preferences#app-list-type) to the `Horizontal List` option, and ensure your prompt message fits perfectly into the custom prompt size. Once you are happy with the size, change the App list type back to `Vertical List` mode.</Note>

                <Note>When configuring custom **Forced Update** messages, the single and multiple App options are not present. This is because forced updates are run on an individual App basis, so the prompts are always single App prompts.</Note>

                The default value is `20` seconds. If you find this too aggressive, you can change the value to suit your needs. The minimum allowed value is `10` seconds.

                Use this preference to define any Apps which if detected as being in the foreground will cause the update prompt to skip.<br />It is recommended that you configure this preference and add any video conferencing or presentation software used across your estate. This will ensure that users don't get prompted to update whilst on a conference call or when presenting.<br />To define an App, you must first get the bundle identifier of the App. To do so, paste the below command into Terminal on a macOS computer that has the App installed (replacing `zoom.us.app` with the name of the App you want to define). Alternatively, if it's an app supported in our [App Catalog](zappl.co/app-catalog) you can find the Bundle Identifier there.
                ```bash
                defaults read /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleIdentifier
                ```
                Copy the resulting bundle identifier to your clipboard and paste it into the `Do Not Disturb Application Bundle ID` preference. You can add as many App bundle identifiers as you require by clicking the **Add Do Not Disturb Application Bundle ID** button.

                Use this preference to ensure that updates are skipped if an application is using assertions. If an application is using the system microphone or playing audio, it should be marked as using assertions.<br />This is useful in scenarios where a user may be in a meeting using a web-based client like Google Meets without a camera on, as the assertion used by the web browser would prevent the update from interrupting the meeting.<br />You can add as many assertion apps as you wish, ensuring to use the correct assertion name format. To get the required assertion name format, run `/usr/bin/pmset -g assertions` in Terminal while the application is running and using assertions.

                This option ensures no update progress prompt is displayed. With this configured, a reminder prompt will be displayed to the user if they attempt to open an app which is being updated.
